# Club Nights

## Wednesday Free-Play Club Meetings

Every week we hold a club night for just casual-play chess, open to everyone to come and enjoy themselves. There are no requirements to entry and no specific experience levels - players of all standards turn up! Currently we average 30 players per night, so there's plenty of opponents to find!

Club nights are currently held on Wednesdays at Christ Church, from 7PM - 9PM.
Check the [termcard](/termcard?all=false&club-nights=true) for more details.

We also tend to assign themes to certain chess club nights. This Hilary we'll likely begin with a few Swiss tournaments, to ease people into playing. In the past we have done:

- A set opening week
- A blitz tournament
- A bullet tournament
- Bughouse
- Longplay
- Fischer-Random Chess

Much more to come in the coming terms!
